# Google AI Studio Workshop

### About
This repository contains the materials and examples from a workshop focused on using large language models (LLMs) to generate dynamic, contextual, and helpful responses to user queries.

The workshop teaches how to leverage powerful AI tools like __Google AI Studio__ or __ChatGPT__ to:

- __Generate Structured Documents__: Create and format complete, self-contained files such as reports, articles, and scripts.

- __Produce High-Quality Prompts__: Master the art of crafting effective prompts that guide an LLM's behavior and output.

- __Answer User Input__: Respond to user requests by dynamically generating content that is ready to be edited, exported, or shared.

Whether you're looking to build an interactive application, automate content creation, or simply enhance your prompting skills, this workshop provides a practical foundation for working with modern AI models.
