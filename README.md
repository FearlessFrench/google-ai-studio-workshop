# Google AI Studio Workshop

### About
This repository contains the materials and examples from a workshop focused on using large language models (LLMs) to generate dynamic, contextual, and helpful responses to user queries.

The workshop teaches how to leverage powerful AI tools like __Google AI Studio__ and __ChatGPT__ to:

- __Generate Structured Documents__: Create and format complete, self-contained files such as reports, articles, and scripts.

- __Produce High-Quality Prompts__: Master the art of crafting effective prompts that guide an LLM's behavior and output.

- __Answer User Input__: Respond to user requests by dynamically generating content that is ready to be edited, exported, or shared.

Whether you're looking to build an interactive application, automate content creation, or simply enhance your prompting skills, this workshop provides a practical foundation for working with modern AI models.

### Repository Structure
The repository is organized into a series of examples, each demonstrating a different aspect of interacting with and generating content from LLMs.

#### Practical Application Concepts
- `01_used_car_price_analysis`: Demonstrates how to use an AI model to analyze data and predict the price of a used car.

- `02_handyman_search`: Shows how to build a system that uses AI to find and recommend services based on user requests.

- `03_conversation_analysis`: Focuses on analyzing conversational data from chatbots or transcripts to extract key insights and topics.

- `04_review_analysis`: Provides an example of using an AI to process and summarize customer reviews to determine overall sentiment.

- `05_review_guided_analysis`: A more advanced example that teaches how to guide the AI to perform specific, targeted analysis on a set of reviews.

- `06_text_classifier`: A foundational example showing how to build a model that can categorize different types of text.

### Getting Started
To get the most out of this repository, you'll need access to an LLM playground like Google AI Studio. You can then use the examples provided in the files to experiment with your own prompts and projects.

Feel free to explore the files in any order you like. Each example is designed to be self-contained and easy to follow.
